        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>My name is Lindsey Maddox I graduated from a full stack web development program at the University of Texas. I have a Bachelor of Science degree from West Texas A&M and a post bachelorette in education. 
          I am a certified teacher of 17 years and am certified to teach every core subject in every grade. I currently hold four certifications. I am changing careers in hopes of finding a career that better fits and 
          stimulates growth in my current phase of life. I believe that integrity and work ethic as well as social skills play a huge part of my future success as a future web developer. I enjoy solving problems and my 
          mentality of never stop learning has helped me to continue to challenge myself. Outside of work I am a mother of three intelligent, kind, and all-around great children. They range from the ages of 9-21! I stay 
          busy with being a single parent but in my free time I enjoy reading and playing volleyball. I have decided to make a career change and have completely dedicated my time, energy, and financial resources to make 
          this happen. I am willing to do whatever is needed to be financially stable and happy in my personal and professional life.</p>
